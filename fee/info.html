        <strong>About Us:</strong><i>Grill Masters started its first outlet in August, 2015 in Yamunanagar (Haryana). The Promoters came from different background but shared a similar passion. Customers loved our menu and gave us a huge success. After testing our products in market, we developed a franchise model. Our franchise model was simple to apply at different locations and, gave opportunities to people to work and earn with us. Grill Masters originally came up with a premier quick service restaurant and later, we also started our dine-in cafes. We offer one of the fastest growing franchise opportunities for the 21st Century. We have a complete fast food restaurant concept tailored to suit qualified investors and investment groups seeking entry into the exciting restaurant industry. As we know that life is better together and everyone is happy when they’re with family. We treat everyone who walks through our doors like an essential part of our family, sharing palatable food with the people we love, and spending the time together. Grill Masters provides fresh food items, hearty portions, good service, fair prices and a multi-choice menu, all these add up to good value for money for customers, and generates brand loyalty as well.</i><br>
